# ColorGame_ReactNative

This is a simple color guessing game created as a practice project to learn React Native. The game works on both iOS and Android platforms and has been tested accordingly. 

## How it works

In this game, the program chooses a random color and hides it among several color boxes. The player has six lives to find the correct color. If they successfully find it, all the colors will change to the right color, and if they cannot find it, the correct answer will be revealed along with the box colors.
