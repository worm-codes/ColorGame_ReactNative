# ColorGame_ReactNative
- It was my practice to learn React Native. Works on IOS and Android(tested).
- It is a color guessing game for children, program picks a random color hides it into color boxes. You have 6 life to find it, if you find it all colors will be turned into right color, if you can not find it will show the right one with box colors.




# # Note: I developed this 1 year ago 20.09.2020 but I got an error about Git so I uploaded it again.
